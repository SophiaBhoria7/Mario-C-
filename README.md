# Mario-C++
This is the Mario Problem Set that is given in the CS50: Intro to CS Problem Sets but in the language of C++, allows me to not only practice some coding but also place authenticity with a new lanugage and expands my exposure. 


/*
This is the description of the file and the instructions

In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-more, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

      #   #
    # #   # #

And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between 0 and 10 (exclusive).
Notice that width of the “gap” between adjacent pyramids is equal to the width of 3 hashes, irrespective of the pyramids’ heights.
