/*
This is the description of the file and the instructions

In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-more, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

      #   #
    # #   # #
  # # #   # # #
# # # #   # # # #

And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive int between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

Notice that width of the “gap” between adjacent pyramids is equal to the width of 3 hashes, irrespective of the pyramids’ heights.
